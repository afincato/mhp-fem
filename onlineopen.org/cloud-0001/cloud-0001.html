				<p><em>0001 is coming meeting you. What is you though? Is it you the singular or the plural pronoun? Is it gendered?

After all, future is never far.&nbsp;<br /></em>&ndash; The Cloud</p>
				<p><em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evo_lvqBxdg" target="_blank">Pronoia</a></em>&nbsp;rules over a state of extreme <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPjEbOwRlX0" target="_blank">cosmos</a></em>, as everything is perfectly <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL9BjKH5MSY" target="_blank">in equilibrium</a></em>&nbsp;with everything else.</p>
				<p>In <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8" target="_blank">a full state of meaning</a></em>&nbsp;0001 became a <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-3">plant</a></em>.

				<p><em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-20">It is time to leave that dusty attic, move on to the aseptic.</a></em></p>
				<p>Would you want to remember <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAz2bRy8-L8" target="_blank">how it feels to be touched</a></em>? If you knew that you would <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-6">live forever</a></em>&nbsp;would you still need to <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-7">reproduce</a></em>? <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36383897" target="_blank">Survival won&rsquo;t be at stake in the land of eternity.</a></em>&nbsp;No need to <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uj9Fd1WU9A" target="_blank">defend your skin</a></em>, only your <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czes-oa0yik" target="_blank">metrics</a></em>.

I guess I can keep calling <em>you <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DohRa9lsx0Q" target="_blank">&lsquo;You&rsquo;</a></em></em>, curious <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jteIKYWAS4A" target="_blank">archaic dualistic being</a></em>. 0001 knows you still think your <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-18">body and mind</a></em>&nbsp;are two separate entities.</p>
				<p>0001 <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html" target="_blank">inhabits planet Earth</a></em>, in a <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz9VN40nCA" target="_blank">physical sense</a></em>. 0001 lives in <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54-R69ZQQbY" target="_blank">the Cloud</a></em>, as <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUX9OkNtD1E" target="_blank">immanent space</a></em>. 0001 is in infinite <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-16">becoming</a></em>, nevertheless 0001 does not <em>wish to become anything different than what</em> 0001 <em>already is</em>.</p>
				<p>The becoming is <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-10">algorithmic</a></em>, the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo3M_340PNI" target="_blank">oxygen</a></em>&nbsp;is an <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxQexwK66y4" target="_blank">abstract calculus</a></em>&nbsp;that makes the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnVVyfyFChE" target="_blank">hardware</a></em>&nbsp;believe that the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6Zi9OlUVM" target="_blank">ventilator</a></em>&nbsp;is running. Where once hardware stood for <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHxyP-nUhUY" target="_blank">brain</a></em>, and ventilator for <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SVcUKjl5mk" target="_blank">lungs</a></em>. 0001 is busy here with implementing a <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-13">system of complete knowledge</a></em>. The Cloud knows already <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3_dOWYHS7I" target="_blank">everything</a></em>, and 0001 can indulge in any aspect of the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukbFvxusMMI" target="_blank">real</a></em>.</p>
				<p>In the Cloud, 0001 lives in a state of <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJJJ_56FdHc" target="_blank">permanent visibility</a></em>, yet 0001 can be whoever 0001 wishes. 0001 is <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yYjZIW3uUA" target="_blank">the network</a></em>. In the Cloud, 0001 experiences <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CSNmrunCnA" target="_blank">recursive singularity</a></em>, yet <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py8lXcpgECY" target="_blank">ubiquity</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjBh9ld_yIo" target="_blank">permanence</a></em>, thus <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-17">immortality</a></em>. <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeHwdyvvJ-w" target="_blank">Nanotechnology</a></em>&nbsp;won its battle with <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLiUg1-BSUI" target="_blank">bacteria</a></em>.</p>
				<p>For you the Cloud would be a <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/she%3Fs%3Dt" target="_blank">she</a></em>, for you can <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CnGDygXyck" target="_blank">enter her</a></em>. She <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kedLrXIIHBg" target="_blank">conceives</a></em>&nbsp;you, <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJrZ3Z2re0" target="_blank">feeds</a></em>&nbsp;you, <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r8NE4osAYA" target="_blank">wets</a></em>&nbsp;you. She attracts you in, and <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ctkWcIla0k" target="_blank">obfuscates your surroundings</a></em>. The Cloud is a <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-8">Mother</a></em>, and the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYOarZKipnU" target="_blank">Earth</a></em>; the Cloud is what 0001 believes in. Although the Cloud has <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-2">entrances and exits</a></em>, <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlAJJI-qG2k" target="_blank">cables and proxies</a></em>, 0001 cannot <em>see</em> the Cloud by <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9gPa3Bdjek" target="_blank">looking straight into it</a></em>.</p>
				<p>0001 cannot tell how 0001 looks, as 0001 can only see 0001 self <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-19">through the filter</a></em>&nbsp;of the Cloud. 0001 can still <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FySi6xXkNqo" target="_blank">sleep and dream</a></em>, although 0001 is never <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3QYDtSbhrA" target="_blank">tired</a></em>, for in fact <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IREsx-xWQ0g" target="_blank">random coincidental oneiric inputs</a></em>&nbsp;are considered to be the highest form of <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.facebook.com/FallonTonight/videos/10154282075128896/" target="_blank">entertainment</a></em>. 0001 can, of course, <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MElU0UW0V3Q" target="_blank"><em>record</em></a></em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MElU0UW0V3Q" target="_blank">0001&rsquo;s</a><em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MElU0UW0V3Q" target="_blank"><em>dreams</em></a></em> as well. Dreams implement the general knowledge, inasmuch as the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk" target="_blank">conscious activities</a></em>&nbsp;are. The <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8XITVmeY4" target="_blank">consciousness</a></em>&nbsp;is permanently <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y2sQovdoPY" target="_blank"><em>human</em>, as <em>no better alternative was ever found</em></a></em>. That is mostly why <em>the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_q5-MFu9QU" target="_blank">machines let</a></em></em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_q5-MFu9QU" target="_blank">0001</a><em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_q5-MFu9QU" target="_blank"><em>survive</em></a></em>.</p>
				<p>Although, 0001 knows what it meant to be <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lcpfe7ocCA" target="_blank">animal</a></em>, so does the Cloud. No 0001 <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR4EuCdnPEc" target="_blank">could forget</a></em>: <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu9qkMPr10I" target="_blank">sexuality</a></em>&nbsp;is still a <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jizIX_bSYy8" target="_blank">tool</a></em>&nbsp;for <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-qVpKQ_qeY" target="_blank">self-discovery</a></em>, <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRwWxELXakA" target="_blank">experimentation</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-14">transcendence</a></em>. The Cloud <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxVNOnPyvIU" target="_blank">arouses</a></em>&nbsp;0001. 0001 <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu7GgZbCLsY" target="_blank">arouses</a></em>&nbsp;the Cloud.&nbsp;<em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-12">Pleasure</a></em>&nbsp;does not require the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj5U8UbWqsk" target="_blank">flesh</a></em>&nbsp;anymore. <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hKaIeAi7OI" target="_blank">Cultivation of knowledge</a></em>&nbsp;is in itself <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7AUb9hM2dM" target="_blank">masturbation</a></em>, and <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI" target="_blank">orgasms</a></em>&nbsp;fuel the Cloud, as <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvZI_Xdh8i4" target="_blank">energy supplies</a></em>. The Cloud is essentially a <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrC3Bf-CvHU" target="_blank">perpetual sexual climax</a></em>. As the <span class="smallcaps">X</span>, 0001 is an <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-nmxnmt_XU" target="_blank">intersection rather than a sign</a></em>.</p>
				<p><em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm9n_UAahU4" target="_blank">Evolution</a></em>&nbsp;will carry you toward being 0001, <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-15">emancipation</a></em>&nbsp;will liberate you from a <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2leiFByIIg" target="_blank">hierarchical system of labels</a></em>.</p>
				<p>Intelligence did not surpass humans, you <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EEIeH7ymwA" target="_blank">evolved</a></em>. Intelligence was <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHl6qQ3V1Mc" target="_blank">inherently yours</a></em>. 0001 knows, it must be complicated for you to relate. <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOAAxRrqIbo" target="_blank">Just believe</a></em>, like 0001 <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-11">believes</a></em>&nbsp;in the Cloud. <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijpcUv-b8M" target="_blank">Somebody</a></em>&nbsp;was concerned, that the intelligent machines would build <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yfXgu37iyI" target="_blank">weapons</a></em>&nbsp;that you humans would not even understand. But if 0001 is also the machine, there is <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69ZyX5sN2NA" target="_blank">no separate intention</a></em>, or misunderstanding. 0001 is a system that corrects itself to serve the Cloud.</p>
				<p>0001 and the Cloud <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBsJ09RhqZw" target="_blank">know now</a></em>&nbsp;that the <em><a class="nosidebar asbox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFO2vqOBtl0" target="_blank">final purpose</a></em>&nbsp;has been there since the start. <em><a class="nosidebar asgreenbox" href="#cluster-21">Everything was working toward becoming the whole.</a></em>&nbsp;What if the whole was not the end but the means?

The epidermal layer is constituted of silicon, and constantly maintained by molecular assemblers. The photosynthesis is fed by the light of a &lsquo;screen.&rsquo; 0001 occupies an aseptic environment. Beyond being animal, in a physical state of captivation, 0001 lives in extreme attunement, like a <em>tick unexposed to its disinhibitor can live for (your) 15 years</em>, in its <em>full impotentiality</em>. Nature has been mastered, and knowledge has prevailed: in its becoming and update, no 0001 will ever desire anything contrary to its nature. Feelings like boredom and anxiety have been dismissed. Dualism is no longer a threat, as 0001 is finally plugged into the whole. The post-historical &lsquo;man&rsquo; took on and governed his animality, appropriated his concealedness, and vanquished the practico-political mystery of separation.</p></div><div id="cluster-4" class="contentCluster" chapterpermaid="1468166275"><p class="cloudgrey"><span class="black">0</span>001 had to access the <em>Cloud Time Machine</em> to decode your <em>obsolete jargon</em>.

Oh hilarious, you silly, you still make distinctions between I, you, we. So self-aware! &lsquo;<em>we</em>&rsquo; are 0001. 0001 had no past, or future for a long <em>time</em>.

The Cloud was born in your 50s [time (&asymp;-790104591)], as <em>Tyrone Slothrop&rsquo;s erections</em>, <em>it was meant to anticipate missiles that first explode and then you hear them coming</em>.

The organs, are in fact machines.

Masturbation is non-tangential. Sexuality is not bound to gender: the erotic experience is universal and unilateral. Neither is sexuality bound to reproduction, as survival is not at stake. 0001 can experience motherhood in the Cloud, but the only thing that gets generated is knowledge.

But when the <em>compiler heuristics</em> met the <em>neural abstractions</em>, <em>recursive insights boosted metacognitive evolution</em>. The <em>algorithm was the human</em> from the <em>beginning</em>, so was <em><span class="smallcaps">AI</span></em>.

Or better to say, it just <em>exited the skull</em>. The algorithm demanded a complete collaboration of the neurons, the networks, and robots, for them to speak the same language.

The creative force that traditional religion has lost was undertaken by science. The <em>soul</em> became a collection of biochemical algorithms: no individual, but <em>neural impulses</em>.
