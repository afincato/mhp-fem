 1. Tele-presence technologies extend our bodies beyond biological 
boundaries in time and space, but prevent us from touching (Arjen 
Mulder)  When we meet in the public domain, we trust each other based on
 reciprocal body language, face-to-face connection, and touch. However, 
in today's social structures, these sensory experiences are increasingly
 replaced by identity scanning technologies. In the digital public 
domain, we are faced with the paradox of ‘the higher surveillance, the 
lower trust’. How do we experience our bodies and identities, 
technically being measured and turned into fixated, controllable 
‘products’? How does this interfere with our identities as social 
constructs, constantly appearing and disappearing when interacting with 
others? Can touch based perception play a role in 'tele-matic trust'? <em>Can I touch you online?</em></p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">MA</span><p class="interview-answer">
 2. Touching is the new Scanning The artists deconstruct and turn around
 control technologies, to facilitate intimate meeting experiences: 
“Saving Face is an experimental technological bio-feedback system for a 
poetic <em>meeting-through-touching ritual</em>. With the help of a personal <em>Touching Face Scan</em>,
 participants caress their own faces, to connect online with family, 
friends and strangers worldwide. In Saving Face, we are digitally 
tangible and visible for each other, in a relational process, a ‘social 
sculpture’; to endlessly meet, caress, mirror and merge.”</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer"> 3. Saving Face is a Smart City Meeting Ritual, and exists of 1. Come close 2. Caress your face 3. Merge and Mirror.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 4. Saving Face uses your face as a tangible social interface The ritual
 includes an interactive city sculpture with a camera and 
face-recognition technologies, connected to an urban screen. In front of
 the camera, you are invited to caress your face. By caressing your face
 you ‘paint’ your portrait on the screen, where it appears and then 
slowly merges with the portraits of previous visitors. The portraits 
merge further through every face-caressing act of following 
participants, co-creating transparent, untraceable, fluid, networked 
identities. Each composed identity is saved into a user generated 
database, to be printed as a Saving Face Passport.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 5. In dynamic public spaces such as museum hall or city square, all 
co-created identities appear on screen as ’digital personas’, sharing 
with us our contemporary public domain. When traveling to various 
geographical and cultural contexts, SF playfully connects — both online 
and offline — different personal historical and cultural backgrounds. 
Participants in cities worldwide ‘Tele-Touch’ each other to meet.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 6. The portrait on screen is part of a social process. Within the 
tradition of the composed and 'morfing' portrait, the artists 
orchestrate 'a social process to create a portrait'. This process 
connects the physical ‘realness’ we feel when touching our faces to the 
interaction with a virtual identity. Each identity on screen appears as a
 digital ‘persona' in our contemporary public domain. As a alternative 
social construct, it constantly appears and disappears in the process of
 merging with others. We imagine ‘The right to be forgotten’ could be 
realized by creating multiple identities. We would disappear by merging 
with others. This would absolutely confuse a control system.</p></div><figure><div style="background-image: url(&quot;pattern3.png&quot;);" class="image-loading"><div></div></div><div class="figure-caption"><span class="caption">Saving Face | Bauhaus Dessau [2012]</span></div></figure><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NE</span><p class="interview-question">
 We regularly see a great variety of works from you as Lancel/Maat. 
Projects such as E.E.G. KISS and Saving Face have received a quite some 
international attention. Were they difficult to produce? Can you tell us
 more about your way of working?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">L/M</span><p class="interview-answer">
 1. We develop our works as artistic research. In our Meeting Spaces and
 Meeting Rituals we deconstruct automated control technologies 
(surveillance, social media, brain computer interfaces, quantifying 
biometric technologies) to rethink and inspire sensitive and reciprocal 
relations based on intimacy, relational presence, tacit knowledge, 
digital synesthesia, bio-synchronisation, sensory and aesthetic 
perception.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 2. In an iterative process, we deconstruct disrupted communication 
models and social systems. This process is both social and technical. It
 is inspired by audience dialogue; developments in media-theory, art 
science and technology. The works are labor intensive. They exist of 
long preparation periods of research and sequences of presentation 
stadia. Each presentation is like a stepping stone in the development of
 the final visual an interaction concept.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 3. But even when having finalized the visual and interaction concept, 
the works keep changing. Each cultural geographical context evokes a 
specific tension and meaning. For example, when showing our interactive,
 full body DataVeil on a square in Istanbul, audience reactions are 
different from showing in Banff Canada. And kissing in E.E.G. KISS is a 
different challenge in Amsterdam then in Hong Kong.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 4. Furthermore, each public presentation space creates a different 
context. For example, at Venice Biennale 2015, IASPIS Stockholm, De 
Appel Amsterdam and Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, our work is part of a 
museological experience. But at Media musea, festivals and conferences 
we show our work in the context of media history and it’s societal 
impact; for example at ISEA Hongkong, Helsinki an Istanbul; Zentrum fur 
Kunst und Medientechnologie, Ars Electronica Linz. And while showing our
 work in dynamic city centers the visual orchestration changes again; as
 well does the audience viewing behavior, for example at Festival ad 
Werf Utrecht, NABI Art Center Seoul and Connecting Cities Berlin, 
Dessau. At Art Science &amp; Technologie exhibitions such as TASIE 
Beijing the audience focuses on experience of social systems, technology
 and innovation. And for Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, we created a specific 
‘Saving Face’ version called ‘Master Touch’, to question and sensitize 
the reflective mode of the museum visitor.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 5. So on many levels each presentation is context specific, and 
inspires the dialogue. The research and dialogue takes place in a varied
 partner network. Many of the works are co-supported by art funds, such 
as Mondriaan Fund, AFK, Stimuleringsfonds. Not only we work with art 
related institutions, but also with Universities, research groups, 
sponsors. Our works emerging from the artistic research are further 
conducted at Delft University of Technology in the context of Lancel’s 
PhD trajectory (Promotores: Prof. dr. Frances Brazier, Dr. Caroline 
Nevejan). For the research we collaborate with programmers, often at 
(artistic) media labs such as V2_Lba, STEIM and Waag Society. Various 
research steps within one project can take place at artists in 
residencies, for example TASML Beijing, Digital Synesthesia Group 
Vienna, IASPIS Stockholm and Bannf Center Canada. E.E.G. KISS was also 
tested at TNO; and sponsored by Fourtress and Philips in Eindhoven, 
invited by Baltan Laboratories.  </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 6. Many of all various steps in these processes are invisible in the 
end. At one hand, we would love to open up this information, and all the
 specific exciting findings in the research; for example in books and 
blogs. At the other hand, this would be very elaborate. More 
importantly, we appreciate the seeming effortless quality of the works, 
as if in fact the act of interfering in systems is a ‘light’ and 
accessible gesture. We hope this ‘lightness’ inspires and communicates 
the possibility as well as the individual power and responsibility to 
interfere.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NE</span><p class="interview-question">
 It strikes me that you as artists predominantly research the 
interactions between humans and technological development? How do you 
view the tension that currently exists between the ever present memory 
and the "right to be forgotten”?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">L/M</span><p class="interview-answer"> We are interested in the connection between physical, embodied memories and digitally, networked memories.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 1. First about memory in relation to our bodies. Our bodies incorporate
 memories. The body can be seen as a container, or a carrier, of memory.
 Our memories are embodied. Our embodied memories ground our individual 
and collective understanding of ourselves in the world around us. They 
direct the way we <em>collectively</em> make sense of our performance 
and relationships. They shape our individual gestures, habits, and 
(un)conscious reactions. Our embodied memories are foundations for our 
scanning mutual trust - through spoken words or with a handshake. Now, 
how do embodied memories emerge? Neurologist A. Damasio<span><span class="footnote-ref clickable">1</span></span>
 describes how memories emerge from emotional interaction during 
reciprocal communication and mirror behaviorbehaviour. This process 
builds on sensory perception of face-to-face connection, body language, 
being close and touch.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 2. How do digitally, networked memories work? Today, technology 
spectacularly extends our bodies beyond biological boundaries in time 
and space. We meet in multi-layered infrastructures, based on various, 
merging forms of on — and offline communication. In these merging 
realities<span><span class="footnote-ref clickable">2</span></span>, we 
meet each other in labyrinthic, fragmented realities. “New forms of 
intimacy, privacy, togetherness and loneliness emerge”, writes Sherry 
Turkle in her book ‘Alone Together’. In merging realities, we extend our
 physical memory by Google, Wikipedia and Social Media. We store our 
memories in commercially contexted databases. Acts of social interaction
 and identification are placed outside our bodies, into digital control 
systems and networks. Scanning, controlling and trusting each other (and
 ourselves) is partly performed by automated technologies. We meet and 
remember as ‘users’ and ‘participants’ via screens, smart objects and 
interfaces. So I ‘Like’ you on Facebook, but where is ‘Hug’ button? 
Biometric scanning (such as Quantified Self) creates an even more 
distant intimacy with our own bodies. We measure our heart rate, sweat 
and brain activity — but how can we share a networked kiss? How will I 
remember the tension of coming close — and touching your lips?</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 3. How do networked technologies influence the trustfulness of our 
bodies as containers of memories to relate to? At one hand, technology 
extends our memory space. Most of our life events are saved in 
databases. More and more memories are always present. At the other hand,
 memories are taken out of the interactive process Damasio describes. 
Instead of emotional interaction during reciprocal communication, we 
make memories appear in a technological process. Memories appear by 
clicking around. By clicking, my memories can appear or anonymous 
memories. I can see your history, within a misleading context, for 
example with in a prison context. I can learn about your prison history 
as if you are still in prison today. Digitally networked memories are 
always now.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 4. In future, what will be our emotional interaction with 
technologically, popping up ‘always present’ memories? And how will this
 influence our relation with our world around? In short: What happens 
with the ever present memory and our understanding of the world around?</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 In previous works we compared the ‘ever present memory’ to the working 
of a post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS). In PTSS, disturbing, painful
 life events that happened in the past seem to be ever happening again, 
for ever ‘now’. They seem to happen again in the presence — but no 
longer within the right context. Someone suffering from PTSS, is haunted
 by memories. In ‘The body keeps it in mind’ (2005), our work in former 
Yugoslavia, we researched how war events for ever color the streets of 
the city, for it’s today’s inhabitants. In ‘TraumaTour’ (1999 - 2008) we
 compared PTSS with feelings of safety and control experienced by our 
digitally ‘networking bodies’. In dynamic city public spaces worldwide 
we created spatial, screen based, dirsuptive networked orchestrations. 
We invited the audience to participate as ‘co-researchers’ in works 
called ‘Agora Phobia (digitalis)’ and ‘StalkShow’. We felt truly touched
 to see the audience exploring their confusion between their present 
bodies, memory and data.</p></div><figure><div style="background-image: url(&quot;pattern2.png&quot;);" class="image-loading"><div></div></div><div class="figure-caption"><span class="caption">E.E.G. KISS | De Brakke Grond  [2015]</span></div></figure><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NE</span><p class="interview-question"> What projects we're going to see in the future from you? And where do you see challenges in achieving this?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">L/M</span><p class="interview-answer">
 1. Currently we feel ‘the right to be forgotten’ shows a somewhat 
defensive attitude. Of course we see the problematic moral implications 
in a democratic society, when we need to judge and balance between 
'privacy' and ‘piracy’. The problematized “right to be forgotten” can 
concern the intention to become truly ‘invisible'. To achieve this, 
going offline, can be the best strategy — although this will be 
increasingly difficult and eventually a luxury.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer"> 2. But more often, “The right to be forgotten” concerns the wish <em>to design</em>
 one’s own visibility. Can we turn around this defensive attitude — and 
create radical, alternative techno-embodied realities?  In E.E.G. KISS 
we do no longer protect our private data. Instead, we create with these 
data new rituals allowing for public intimacy and relational rituals. 
E.E.G. KISS invites for a shared neuro-feedback kiss ritual in today’s 
merging realities. In this way, we aim to create a shared sensitive 
public space, response-ability for the power of synchronizing through 
touching, breathing, kissing, dancing, sharing presence. Worldwide, we 
invite our audiences for this on going artistic research; and to 
participate in a communal, networked E.E.G. KISS. We are convinced that 
artists are key in the research and design process for these new 
participatory ‘trust-systems’.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NE</span><p class="interview-question">
 What are possible alternative environments that could be introduced in 
the future? How would these environments be linked? In what way would we
 manipulate them?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">L/M</span><p class="interview-answer">
 We research social systems in a mediated society; systems merging 
humans and technology. There will be a lot more seamless invisible as 
well as status expressing technologies developed in the near future. For
 us as artists it will be a challenge to deconstruct, visualize and 
rethink the implications of the use and design on and in our bodies. 
Instead of looking for prosthetic interfaces, we focus on alternative 
possibilities for mirror processes, brain interfaces and neuro-feedback.
 How do archived data permeate our personal lives, and behavior?</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
 Current bio-feedback technologies (such as brain computer interfaces) 
allow us to create networked set ups, to artistically design and reflect
 on the communal, networked experience of social and biometric devices. 
It allows us to orchestrate public feedback-system rituals for 
data-reflection.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer"> In E.E.G. KISS we ask: <em>Can
 I kiss you online? Can we transfer a kiss and it’s intimacy online? Can
 we measure a kiss and what kissers feel together? Can we trust our 
E.E.G. KISS?</em> And in terms of ‘The Right to be forgotten’: <em>Do we want to save our private kisses in a transparent database — to be used by others?</em></p></div></div><p class="article-author-bio"></p></div></div></div><p class="footnotes-title">Footnotes</p><div class="column three"><div class="fixedscrollableparent"><div class="fixedscrollable"><div class="footnotes"></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
