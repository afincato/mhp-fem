</div><div class="article-subtitle"></div><div class="article-author">Esteban Gomez-Rosselli</div><div class="article-author">Interview with Noam Toran</div><div class="article-author-info">Artist</div><div class="article-date-location">29 November 2017 via a video call between Design Academy Eindhoven and Rotterdam, NL</div></div><div class="article-text"><p>In his lecture for Open Set Lab 2017, the artist <a href="http://www.noamtoran.com/NT2009/" target="_blank">Noam Toran</a>
 discussed the transgressive potential of alternative narratives and 
para-literature, in the context of the vast audio-visual archive, where 
the lecture took place. He raised questions about how misreading and 
misinterpreting the archive in a conscious manner might result in the 
creation of fictions that allow for the generation of alternative 
perspectives, and a more complex understanding of reality. 
</p><p>Toran’s work encompasses films, performances, exhibitions — the 
work is less about concrete results than it is about orchestrating 
situations through which themes, usually those that question social 
conformity, take voice through objects and narratives. Toran resists 
labelling himself as a critical designer or an artist, focusing instead 
on how his work can explore historical periods and objects, and their 
influences. He insists that memory and fiction are not really two things
 apart, and that the lines between them can blur to revale new and 
unexpected perspectives.

<div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">Esteban Gomez Rosselli</span><p class="interview-question">Hey Noam.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">Noam Toran</span><p class="interview-answer">Hey Esteban. Can you see me? Oh no, wait, I need to turn the cam on.
</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">Can you hear and see me now?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">Perfectly. Can you tell me what you’re working on at the moment?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Uhm…
 what am I doing at the moment? I have a show at my gallery in Tel Aviv 
for next year. That’s really the major project in front of me and I’m 
working on a project that in some ways is a continuation of what I 
showed in the introduction to my Open Set project, where I’m producing a
 kind of science fiction play about the real workers union in Palestine 
in the 1930s, so in the pre-independence British mandate Palestine. So, 
I’m turning to a lesser-known period and drawing out a piece of 
historical material that I think it’s relevant, to try and understand 
where Israel went wrong, politically and ideologically.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">How do you decide what historical moment interests you in order to begin a project like that?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">I
 think it starts with something that has been pulling me towards some 
area of interest. But it’s also something localized, a focused context, 
which helps in the telling of a story, and means that a story can be 
quite accurate. If the characters in it are already historically and 
geographically located somewhere, and there is some flavour to the time 
I’m looking at, this informs my aesthetic decisions. So, for me, it’s 
about finding an accurate space to work with and then drawing it out 
into the narrative structures that are connected to science fiction<span><span class="footnote-ref clickable">1</span></span>
 or ghost fiction or something like that to try to layer that moment 
with a kind of greater perspective, be it historical, ideological or 
otherwise. 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">You
 were born in New Mexico, you grew up in San Francisco, and you have 
Jewish ancestry. Now you live in Rotterdam. Do you think these different
 cultural or transcultural perspectives affect the way you confront 
historical materials?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Possibly,
 yeah. I think I grew up in a pretty liberal-minded, politically very 
leftist family and so, if I learned anything through my experience and 
education, it has been to really embrace the complexity of historical 
political circumstances and not to consider things in the sharp contrast
 of black and white; that there are complexities, that there are 
hypocrisies and that there are problematics that are not just a binary 
condition. Trying to understand a range of experiences, a range of 
ingredients that produce a political and historical cocktail is 
something that I have always accepted. 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">Considering
 your awareness of the complexity of political situations — and your 
acknowledgement that archival material has already been infected by 
ideological conditions — what is the best way to approach the archival 
material and confront it in an environment like the <a href="https://beeldengeluid.nl/en" target="_blank">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">I
 think an environment like the Netherlands Institute for Sound and 
Vision is amazing at every level — that building, that space. It is an 
amazing example of a <a href="https://youtu.be/1QEbCMda8AQ?t=47" target="_blank">‘national narrative’</a>
 being told, where we, as outsiders, really even at the level of the 
language, we are coming to it as a piece of science fiction. Our only 
tangible connection to this narrative is through this dignified museum, 
where we recognize the framework — we have been to museums like that 
elsewhere — but the content is totally alien to us. <a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=UVvuUeD3t5UC&amp;amp;pg=PA162&amp;amp;dq=muppets+different+countries&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyy-nMgenYAhUpIsAKHWJEDgUQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=muppets%20different%20countries&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank">The puppets are not the puppets of our own childhoods</a>.
 So, this idiosyncratic nation-specific material becomes some kind of a 
weird, distorted hallucinatory version of what we know from our own 
childhoods. I think that the Institute is already questioning how a 
nation perceives itself through media. As outsiders, we are in a really 
fortunate situation because we are not invested in the material 
nostalgically or otherwise. We don’t care, we don’t know anything about 
it, and we come to it as aliens, and that perspective is critical to 
provide a kind of postcolonial reading of such material. Often such 
material tends to under-represent, let’s say, immigrant groups or 
minority groups of importance in the cultural, and even physical, 
building of a nation. They tend to be marginalized in media so it’s 
interesting to extract these small stories and blow them up so people 
  can see them.</p>

<div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">In that line of thought, to bounce back you’re brief to you- <span><span class="footnote-ref clickable">2</span></span> 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">That is lazy journalism Esteban, bouncing questions... <em>[laughing]</em>
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">OK:
 What opportunities arise when misreading the archive, what is the 
potential of these things from the past to modify the future?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">It’s
 to provide a different reading of the material, and again if that 
reading is done through a filter of foreignness, or otherness, then I 
think it has value. If the Institute for Sound and Vision creates a 
cathedral-like framework where we walk into this space that is heavily 
coded with this kind of scale and rendering of how material is digested 
either by citizens coming to the museum or by researchers, we can also 
create another frame within this sci-fi building in which we can examine
 how Holland renders itself through these institutions.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">And is this how you framed your brief for the <a href="http://www.openset.nl/" target="_blank">Open Set</a> participants?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">My
 initial proposition was really a way to consider an approach to the 
archive but it wasn’t a brief in itself. A lot of the participants 
already have their own ideas of how they want to get involved with the 
material and my role is more as kind of a support mechanism helping them
 to consider this approach. Last time we met they showed me what they 
were thinking about and I helped them consider ways to produce the 
material, to turn the research of the material into something that may 
be considered a finished film or product in some kind. 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">Do
 you think this disruptive engagement with archival material has special
 relevance today in the times of Google and massively available content 
with algorithmic categorization, one click away, responding to our 
habits?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Yes
 and no. Google, YouTube… these are the great archives of the world. 
These citizen-based uploading practices are remarkable and, in a way, 
it’s up to us to produce the kind of taxonomy we want in order to use 
the material from a critical perspective. In this case we need to have 
something like a ‘national archive’, which defines itself using 
structures such as having to collect everything that is broadcast. What I
 also like about that approach is that is must engage with the full 
spectrum of material — both highbrow and lowbrow material — what is 
considered culturally acceptable within the frameworks of television. 
The British Library is required by law to collect every publication 
produced in the UK, and consequently ends up having the largest 
collection of pornography in the world! That produces this wonderful 
pink haze in a corner of the British Library — this cornucopia of 
pornography maybe metres away from the Gideon Bible or something; it’s 
quite amazing to consider the ironies of that.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">

<div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">You were talking about the ironies of accepting lowbrow materials...
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">What’s
 important is that it is all relevant and once we consider that it is up
 to us... You know some of the greatest cultural and political theorists
 are those that can extract from what seem like irrelevant ways to 
understand the society they are looking into. We can learn from those 
kinds of writers and theorists. I’m more drawn to the lowbrow material —
 be it film, or TV, or comics, or kids TV programs — precisely to 
understand the spectrum of society and television that are not always 
valued. 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">And on the impact of media, of this cinematographic moodiness…
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Definitely,
 the ability to steer us as viewers. The emotional registers are an 
important part of what is considered the format. And some of it is 
really just trickery, you know, and that is nice to consider. And it is 
nice to participate, when producing the work, by using the tricks of the
 trade. A lot of the Open Set participants are actually really 
interested in deconstructing the codes of production — how something is 
made and what tricks are being used. When we look at documentary, for 
example, it can use devices such as an overbearing soundtrack to tug at 
the heartstrings. All these things should be considered when watching, 
and it’s really nice that the participants are after that.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">With this trickery in production, what do you find fascinating about the way that format can reshape memory?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Trickery
 or otherwise I think, from my own experience, I have a more porous 
memory than others — our revisiting of ourselves in the past tends still
 to be for the most part visual. There might be one aspect of it that is
 very true to that moment. The rest we fill in, because we need to, 
because we are not that satisfied; we are seeing this tiny fragment we 
render in the screen of an overall perspective. We don’t really 
remember, we fill it in, often with material that has been given to us 
through media and that’s not really our own. Everything tends to get 
grainy and mushy. That grain, that mushiness, that muddiness is where 
the most interesting critical perspectives lie, where some of the most 
interesting works lie. 
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">Do you have any particular fictions you constantly come back to?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-answer">Yes, two short fiction writers I always return to are <a href="http://ubu.com/film/borges_portrait.html" target="_blank">Jorge Luis Borges</a> and <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3059/raymond-carver-the-art-of-fiction-no-76-raymond-carver" target="_blank">Raymond Carver</a>.
 I mean, I’m not a writer but if there is a kind of translation aspect 
to the kind of work that I do then it tends to concern narratives that 
have a short story format. So I am always returning to them<span><span class="footnote-ref clickable">3</span></span>,
 even as technical artists, for what they are capable of producing in 
such a distilled format, the compression of the scenarios, the 
efficiency, the emotional resonances. Is that ok?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-question">Yes fantastic, thank you Noam!
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-question">How are you going to format this interview?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">EGR</span><p class="interview-answer">We are still discussing it, but want to engage with the raw transcripts to add different layers to them.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">NT</span><p class="interview-question">Sounds like a great experience, I think.
