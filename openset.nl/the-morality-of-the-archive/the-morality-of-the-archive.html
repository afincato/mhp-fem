</div></div><div class="article-text"><p>In a world of information
    abundance, the contextualisation of images and stories is an arduous
    task. The sheer amount of available content from archives, the internet
    and mainstream media has created an intimidating platform that expects
    individuals to stay turned on and ever attentive.
</p><p>
    I met Annette Behrens in her studio in Rotterdam. The empty halls of the
    building emanated an inviting calm, and as Behrens put the kettle of
    hot water to boil for some green tea in her studio, it became clear that
    this was her haven away from the chaos that is the archive. Behrens is
    an artist who deals with the bountiful amounts of archival materials by
    weaving personal narratives into photography, video and text to produce
    printed publications and projects. Behrens is interested in the ‘other’
    and how commonly-held perspectives of groups that deviate from the norm
    come to be. Her work asks: how are groups and individuals portrayed once
    subjected to the archive and how is this helpful? Are there new
    perspectives to be uncovered and considered?
</p><p>At Open Set Lab 2017, Behrens spoke about her collaborative project  <a href="https://vimeo.com/141573791" target="_blank"><em>(In Matters of) Karl</em></a>, a print publication that documents the results of her investigation into the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6cker_Album" target="_blank">Höcker Album</a>
    — a photo-album anonymously gifted to the United States Holocaust
    Memorial Museum in 2007 that depicts the ‘everyday’ activities of Nazi
    officers working in Polish concentration camps during the Second World
    War. Due to her German heritage, Behrens was fascinated by the new
    perspectives and issues this photo album unwittingly reveals to the
    public.

    <div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">Tiiu Meiner</span><p class="interview-question">Where does your interest in exploring the idea of the ‘other’ come from?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">Annette Behrens</span><p class="interview-answer">I
        grew up in Germany and I lived there until I was about 21 years old. My
        dad grew up in the 1940s and was always telling me stories about the
        Second World War. He grew up in the midst of the war but was very young.
        After the war ended, it was too immediate a history to recount, so
        people wouldn’t talk about it. He didn’t learn about the war in school,
        and grew up proud to be German because of the other aspects of German
        history, and the culture, the writers and musicians they were taught
        about instead. Later, he found out about what the same Germany that he
        was proud to be a part of, was also capable of.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">I think my
        father’s realisation influenced me a lot. Now we are confronted with all
        that history, all the time. It’s something that was always part of my
        schooling and education. It’s something you became extremely aware of
        when travelling abroad. I would, for a really long time, and it’s only
        changed in the last few years, be really embarrassed to say I was from
        Germany because that horrific history was such an immense part of what I
        grew up with.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">How we look
        at each other, via photography and the media, can influence our
        perspective of one another and how we think a person should be treated.
        You see this in the history of the Second World War and how far that
        influence can go. This is the starting point for my work.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">How do you identify a group as ‘other’?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">In the first instance, intuitively.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">Then you
        slowly begin to understand, ‘this is what I have been interested in’.
        I’m a lot more aware of this now, and especially the role that
        photography plays in my work, and of how we exclude people or simplify
        information. And, in recent years, how the gaps in our historical
        writing have become more evident.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">If you look
        at the Netherlands right now and which voices are missing within the
        history that we are writing through the archive, it’s a really important
        discussion — that everything we keep is only a part of something; it’s
        always fragments. For a really long time I don’t even think there was an
        acknowledgement in the public sphere that it’s only fragments we’re
        keeping, and that there are that many more voices that also should also
        be included.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">What is your process for researching these groups you’ve identified as being ‘outside of the norm’?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">It’s
        always very broad, which can be a little frustrating. I try to include
        all the layers I’m interested in, which takes a lot of time to research
        and investigate. <a href="http://www.annettebehrens.com/soymain.html" target="_blank">The project that I’m working on now is about the soybean</a>,
        because I recently changed my diet and became very enthusiastic about
        it. Then I thought, ‘How could I use this in my work as a visual
        artist?’. It was with this thought that I identified the soybean as a
        topic that’s very controversial. People are often either very positive
        or very negative about it. This plant and how we view it fits right into
        what I’m interested in. So, after this kind of realisation I become
        fascinated by a topic and can get buried in it. I always try to have
        different types of information sitting next to each other, and then find
        a way to make it accessible for somebody else. </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">Do you do a lot of field work?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">Yes,
        usually. I’ve travelled a lot within the Netherlands, and I just came
        back from the US where I was at the Henry Ford archive. Henry Ford did
        extensive research on the soybean in the 1940s. I hope to go to Brazil
        in 2018. I was in the US three years ago. It’s one of the biggest
        international producers of soy. I visited at the research lab at the
        University of Illinois, and places like that. </p></div>

        are some of the biggest issues that you’ve encountered whilst

        project, it’s about the perpetrators. Generally, people don’t like to
        look at these photographs. For me, photographs are a mirror to reflect
        ourselves nowadays, but I also wanted to do justice to the victims. It’s
        about both of these things. I was really careful with the information —
        everything was checked again and again. All the numbers were right.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">For the  <a href="http://www.annettebehrens.com/boyzmain.html" target="_blank"><em>Boyz</em> | ████</a>
        project about Moroccan youth in the Netherlands, I wanted to do justice
        to those subgroups and to understand what that justice means for them.
        But, also, to have an almost neutral work, in which the audience is
        confronted with different perspectives and have to position themselves
        accordingly.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">Have
        you ever found yourself in a position where you were uncertain whether
        or not you might be doing more harm to the subject you were researching?
        Have you had to confront the boundary between what types of subject
        matter should be given a voice and what shouldn’t?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">With the <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em>
        project, the information and images that we see are often so
        simplified, and that’s what I become afraid of. A singular image can be
        taken out of context and simplified. You don’t have any control over
        that. What I’m after is the ability to supply more context and nuance. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
        Images, such as those used in the <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em> project,
        have already been used by a lot of different media outlets, and have
        been put into certain contexts. I want to apply even more background
        information, and to combine it with my own story and keep the context
        personal. Then these images don’t simply depict these perpetrators that
        have committed horrific unimaginable crimes, but help to bring this
        story back to yourself. It’s no longer removed from your personal
        experience like when something like this appears in a newspaper.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">You can
        relate it to your own experience, your own behaviour and the politics
        that are going on at the time. The simplification of something, through
        images, is something I’m both afraid of and fascinated by.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">How
        do you situate yourself within your relationship to the ‘other’ and the
        ‘norm’? Where do you see yourself within the narratives of your
        research?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">In the case of the <em>Boyz | ████</em>
        project about Moroccan youth, this was the first time I situated myself
        as the storyteller and could act as a translator for the public to
        enable them to question what harm images used in the media can do to a
        group such as the Netherland’s Moroccan youth.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">Images I
        used in the publication were sent to me by the boys themselves. Their
        group was hard to approach because they were so aware of the negative
        images news media was using to portray them. So, I used the images they
        used to portray themselves. I did make some of the images, but for me it
        was really important to have their perspective included.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">You
        have received criticism for working with groups that others have deemed
        dangerous. Why do you think it is important to conduct research into
        perspectives that have been considered as potentially harmful
        influences?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">AB:
        I hope I can make people question their own perspectives, to create a
        little more understanding towards each other, but also to highlight how
        the media uses certain images in dangerous ways when portraying certain
        groups.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">There’s one
        particular image that was used in a lot of news stories about
        aggressive Moroccan youth. That image doesn't appear in the actual work
        but I oftentimes use it in lectures to show how harmful wrongful use of
        images can be. It’s a photo where you see a barbed wire fence and group
        of Moroccan youths with hoodies trying to hide their faces. You see a
        barracks in the background. It was used extensively in the Dutch media
        with all these super negative headlines about how to cope with their
        behaviour. But the photo was actually taken in <a href="http://www.kampwesterbork.nl/en/index.html#/index" target="_blank">Kamp Westerbork</a>,
        a Dutch transition camp where people in the Second World War were be
        taken to before being moved to camps such as Auschwitz. The boys in the
        photo were listening to a story by a guide who was a survivor of the
        camp. There just happened to be photographers there. Some of these
        youths didn’t want to be photographed, which is everyone’s right. But
        the context of the photo is almost never mentioned and was entirely
        different from what was being written about. This case shows how
        misleading images can be.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">Taking the <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em> project as an example, to what extent should archivists be shaping moral discourse?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">I
        think the archive definitely has a responsibility, but it’s difficult
        because there’s also these daily goings-on that happen in the archive,
        the adding of information, stuff like that. That can be difficult to
        remember but it’s also a part that needs to be addressed.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">All
        archives have different approaches. I’ve just visited one where they
        were really protective about which images you’re allowed to use and how
        they’re used. You have to write everything down. It’s understandable,
        but this also makes it really difficult to have a more open discussion
        about the images we keep.
        I wish more archives were more open source. That could lead to the
        addition of more diverse perspectives on the images that we keep. For me
        the point of the archive is that we have this collective knowledge, and
        collection of images, and that people who are not necessarily part of
        an institution can contribute. Institutions, not only the individual
        archivists, have a responsibility to share their images and information
        and make them accessible for all kinds of people.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">What is your understanding of ‘citizen archives’? Does it help that people now have their own personal archives?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">I
        think it is getting a bit narcissistic, but that’s also interesting.
        These types of archives are not necessarily included in my research.
        They can be useful but all those unassigned images can also be
        confusing. Maybe image makers should have an increased responsibility to
        share their knowledge about what their images and their content can be
        used for.</p></div>

        I don’t. But I do try to present a sense of neutrality. In the last two
        projects, I included my own personal story but I also included factual
        and historical information about how to read certain images. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">I
        don’t know if the complete work has to come across as unemotional, but
        it has to be really clear where the perspective comes from and whose
        perspective it is. Factual information can help the public to approach a
        subject from different perspectives and to not simply respond
        emotionally. Not that I think emotional responses are bad, but often
        they get in the way of a layered approach. For instance, I was at a
        lecture recently and I was asked why I didn’t put the historical images
        at the beginning of the <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em> book. It was a
        conscious decision not to do that. Because those images become shocking
        when you find out their context. Emotion keeps us from really looking
        and reflecting on these images. When you have a range of different
        perspectives, reflecting on these images without actually showing them,
        you have more space to communicate these perspectives before shock and
        emotion set in, and make it difficult for any other information to get
        across.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">Have
        you experienced any of your work inciting controversy rather than
        creating a better understanding of any of the groups you’ve researched?
        How do you know whether or not you have done your subject matter a
        disservice?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">I received one or two negative messages about <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em>,
        criticising the podium I gave to the images and the people portrayed in
        them. I did think, ‘Ok, that person didn’t really read the book, didn’t
        really read the text.’
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">I think the thoroughness of the research I do protected me from negative comments.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">What have been the most rewarding aspects of working with the topics you have chosen?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">The <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em>
        book was the work that has received the most attention because of the
        content. If I had completed this work earlier then I would have had a
        completely different outcome. Over the years, a new context for this
        research emerged, which helped me gain new insights and find new images
        and information. So, getting the response I was hoping for, is really
        rewarding.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">How important is collaboration within your practice?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">Very.
        I am a bit of an ‘einzelgänger’. Do you know this word? It’s a German
        word for when you like to be by yourself, and you like to do things by
        yourself. This is what I’m like. But then having to work with different
        people, especially with <a href="http://www.hansgremmen.nl/demo-item" target="_blank">Hans Gremmen</a>,
        I realised that you simply can’t do everything yourself, even if you’d
        like to. Some people can, but I think you add more depth to your work if
        you collaborate.

    <div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">I knew I didn’t have the knowledge to make a publication like the <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em>
        book. So I approached the publisher Fw:Books and I knew I really wanted
        to work with Hans because of his previous work. Hans is a fantastic
        designer and he had so much knowledge about paper and printing. That’s
        something I could never have acquired by myself, so I think it is
        absolutely necessary to include people from different fields. Also
        working with <a href="http://www.eenentwintig.org/" target="_blank">Raymond Frenken</a>, who wrote one of the texts, and <a href="https://www.kazernedossin.eu/EN/ContactPages/Organisatie/Directie" target="_blank">Christophe Busch</a>, who wrote the biography of Karl Höcker was beneficial.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">I had a lot
        of discussions with Raymond during the production of the book, about
        the content and the history. His background is in writing and he’s a
        really good researcher. He understood what I wanted to say and added to
        it.
    </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">TM</span><p class="interview-question">How did researching <em>(In Matters of) Karl</em> influence your own personal archive? Do you think it’s important to have a personal archive?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AB</span><p class="interview-answer">I
        try to keep an image archive that’s accessible for me, but also
        available for the people I work with. Maybe this project did bring more
        awareness about the value of family archives. Accessing these ‘family
        archives’ will always be difficult. Some people really want to share
        them, and some absolutely won’t. Often for understandable reasons.
        Working with other archives made me realise the importance of keeping an
        accessible archive myself. Not only for a particular project, but in
        general. I have been influenced by seeing many different archives and
        the rules they follow. As well as how archivists and others involved in
        the archive have influence over how images are distributed. Yeah, I was
        made more aware of this.</p></div></div><p class="article-author-bio">During

                <div class="abstract">There is nothing new in camera images shot by amateurs being able to play a role as evidence and as a visual resource in the reporting and interpretation of signiﬁcant events – witness the Zapruder ﬁlm of the assassination of J.F. Kennedy or the Rodney King video tape. Now, however, digital media and the Internet seem to make an increasing intrusion of amateur images in the professional media inevitable. What is the status of these ‘wild’ images in the public domain? Do they reveal the new blind spots of the ofﬁcial news media? Or do they primarily demonstrate a public desire for images that almost eradicate the distance from events?</div>
