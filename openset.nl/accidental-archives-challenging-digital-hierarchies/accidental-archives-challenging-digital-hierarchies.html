</div></div><div class="article-text"><p><a href="https://jonaslund.biz/" target="_blank">Jonas Lund</a>&nbsp;is
    a difficult man to pin down. The 34-year-old Swedish artist is,
    ostensibly, based in Berlin and in Amsterdam. But in reality, he is
    often out of the country for talks and exhibitions, making organising an
    interview quite a challenge.</p><p>Interest in Lund’s work has grown
    alongside a blossoming cultural scepticism towards technology, data and
    the internet — subjects that are often the focus of his provocative and
    wide-ranging work. Examples include <em>Gallery Analytics,</em> where he tracked the movements of visitors around a gallery and made the  <a href="http://galleryanalytics.com/realtime/4.html" target="_blank">data publicly available</a>, and  <a href="https://jonaslund.biz/works/the-fear-of-missing-out/" target="_blank"><em>The Fear of Missing Out</em></a>,
    where an algorithm analysed works by successful contemporary artists
    and created instructions for making art, which was then displayed. For
    the 2014 project  <a href="http://studio-practice.biz/" target="_blank"><em>Studio Practice</em></a>),
    Lund turned a gallery into a production line with workers making art
    from an instruction book and being assessed by a panel before being
    signed, all broadcast live via a website. More recent works include <em>Away on Vacation</em>
    — a live stream of his MacBook Pro running a piece of software that
    creates paintings by scripting the movement of the cursor and keyboard —
    and  <a href="https://jonaslund.biz/works/critical-mass/" target="_blank"><em>Critical Mass</em></a>, a space that changes based on user actions and feedback submitted live via a website.

</p><p>After a series of missed emails, re-scheduled appointments, and
    technological glitches, we finally sat down to talk via Skype while Lund
    was in Paris for a lecture and the ‘Critical Mass’ exhibition at École
    Municipale des Beaux-Arts/Galerie Édouard-Manet.</p><figure><div style="background-image: url(&quot;pattern1.png&quot;);" class="image-loaded"><img src="../assets/imgs/5a68a80323949-Jonas%2520Lund%2520Studio%2520Practice-sm.jpg" class="image loaded"></div><div class="figure-caption"><span class="caption"><em>Studio Practice,</em> 2014, shown at Boetzelaer|Nispen in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and broadcast live on studio-practice.biz.

How’s it going?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">Anna Winston</span><p class="interview-answer">Not too bad, it’s been a long day and I guess the same for you.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Yeah, I’m pretty tired so let’s see if I have some smart answers for you.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Maybe we could start with you introducing yourself?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Ok, so I will say it like this: <em>[Ironic voice]</em>
    Jonas Lund is Swedish artist who creates paintings sculpture,
    photography, websites and performances that critically reflect on
    contemporary network systems and power structures. He was born in Sweden
    and is based in Berlin and Amsterdam.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question"><em>[Laughs]</em> Does the theme of Open Set Lab 2017, <em>Memories of the Future</em>, reflect the things that you are interested in at the moment?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer"><em>Memories of the Future</em>
    — it’s pretty vague in some sense. You can project many different
    things towards it. If you’re talking about an archive as a concept,
    that’s something which is an innate quality of my work, because most of
    the works produce some kind of archive or documentation, so in that
    sense it’s relevant. It would be a bit of a stretch to say that that’s
    my main concern, but there’s something about it which is quite
    prevalent, let’s say. It’s an integral part of most artistic practices,
    whether that’s purely for documentation purposes or part of a creative
    practice or process of how you make something.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">One
    of the things that is so interesting about your work is that it’s quite
    hard to label. But could we talk about your work, in part, as a
    critical, digital archival practice?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">It’s
    a pretty funny one. I don’t necessarily disagree. I think it’s all a
    question of how specific you want to become and I think in quite a lot
    of my work, the basis for it is pretty specific. In that sense, the work
    itself can become a reflection of a certain technology or a certain
    structure or a certain behaviour in the online digital technical sphere.
    And by the mere fact of producing that work it also becomes an archive
    of that event. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">

    In the example of  <a href="http://flip-city.net/" target="_blank"><em>Flip City</em></a>
    — which is fun to bring up because it’s not very digital — this
    painting series with GPS trackers to address a flip market, this flip
    market doesn’t exist anymore in the same capacity. It’s silly to talk
    about historical reference points when it’s just a couple of years ago,
    nevertheless it becomes a historical point that could enter into some
    kind of archive, or maybe the work itself becomes a reflection of their
    position and that becomes the archiving process. So for sure it can be
    like this. I had some other things on my mind, but I lost the second
    point! Shit.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Don’t
    worry! It’s interesting that you said that a couple of years ago
    doesn’t feel like history, but in the kind of media that you work with a
    couple of years can be quite a long time.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Yeah,
    it’s a very long time and it’s not a very long time. It’s both.
    Supposedly technology and innovation move very quickly and a lot of new
    things emerge, but then the same basic systems of control and hierarchy
    still exist. I’m not actually interested in specific technologies. It’s
    kind of the opposite. It’s more the effects of technology, it’s what it
    produces, the subjectivity it informs if you have to spend all of your
    waking hours staring at Facebook. So, it’s both. In my work, it’s always
    double — everything has two interpretations, two meanings, two points
    of departure. You can be a fan [of technologies like Facebook], you can
    approve, and you can think ‘oh yeah that’s interesting’, or you can be
    extremely critical.&nbsp;   </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">In
    a previous interview, you said that artists shouldn’t preach their
    opinions about their own work. Does this relate to this double meaning
    in your work?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">It’s
    more of a position to say that. Very few works function like that,
    because it’s more [like] propaganda where you’re trying to directly
    influence someone’s opinion. So it’s all very ambiguous in some sense.
    Which is also then employed as a strategy or as a way of showing that
    there are multiple readings of everything.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">In
    Western society, ambiguity is typically seen as a weakness, because you
    can’t choose between this and that. But from the psychoanalysis point
    of view, ambiguity and being in an ambiguous state is just evidence of a
    very strong conflict. There is very strong conflict between all the
    different binary positions in some super strange way. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">
    I think what I meant to say, in saying that artists shouldn’t push their
    points of view, is that the works I like mostly don’t. You have to
    leave some type of magic in there. If it’s too preachy it’s just
    tedious. </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">I know you trained originally as a photographer…</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer"><em>[Laughs]</em> That’s true!</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">And
    then you got into programming. I wonder if there’s still some kind of
    relationship between the way you see the world as a photographer and the
    way you are now using that as a lens onto something quite different.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Hmmm,
    that’s a good question! I don’t think in my work that the method is
    that similar to when I was using photography as a tool. Photography felt
    like a limitation rather than an opportunity. Because you are stuck
    with this device that will gaze upon the world. It will always end up as
    a picture. But, for sure, there are similarities in the sense that you
    always work with tools that can enable different types of perceptions
    and different types of readings in what you see.

</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">There are
    only a few contemporary artists that are solely photographers. Most of
    them are old. And German. And they’re fantastic artists, like  <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/thomas-struth-2339" target="_blank">Thomas Struth</a> and  <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/candida-hofer-5119" target="_blank">Candida Höfer</a>.
    But, of course, there’s new and interesting types of photography
    enabled by [the fact that] everybody has a camera anyways, so… What’s
    your point of view? Did you see any good photography works in the last
    five years that were super contemporary, that were amazing?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">I don’t know that I have. But that’s interesting because it’s only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/19/photography-is-it-art" target="_blank">relatively recently</a>
    that we’ve accepted photography as an art form rather than as a
    disposable medium. And I guess you’re working with types of media that
    also haven’t always been accepted as art...</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">All
    the major museums in the world are starting to collect different types
    of online works and they’ve done multiple exhibitions on this now. This
    whole conservatism for the medium in the art world is kind of over. All
    that old-fashioned shit of ‘this is accepted and that’s not’, that’s
    over. The world changed pretty quickly. Everyone has an iPhone in their
    pocket, so do you really want to care about if photography is an art
    form or not, should that be your concern? Probably not, right?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">In terms of the relationship with museums and the ‘establishment’, if you have a project like <em>Critical Mass</em>,
    for example, or some of the projects that have involved a lot of live
    participation, does the idea of it being collected change it?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Welllll,
    yes, I think in some sense. It depends very much on what it is, but
    underlying most of the work is some set of rules which kind of functions
    as a set of instructions. I know from my friends who work primarily in
    performance, that if they would sell work to a private collector or a
    museum, it basically comes as a set of instructions for restaging, so I
    think that’s the smart solution. But so far, I haven’t really been in
    that position where I have to reflect on it properly.</p></div><figure><div style="background-image: url(&quot;pattern3.png&quot;);" class="image-loaded"><img src="../assets/imgs/5a68a9146e509-Joans%2520Lund%2520Critical%2520Mass.jpg" class="image loaded"></div><div class="figure-caption"><span class="caption"><em>Critical Mass</em>, 2017, shown at École Municipale des Beaux-Arts/Galerie Édouard-Manet in Paris, France, and on critical-mass.network.

</span></div></figure><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Do works like <em>Fear of Missing Out</em> and <em>Gallery Analytics</em> relate to a kind of social anxiety around different expressions of digital culture?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">I
    suppose... I’ve noticed in the last two years this question appears
    much more frequently than before. And I think that’s already an
    indication of what’s on people’s minds, that everybody understands —
    slowly, maybe, maybe faster — that it’s not what it’s made out to be.
    The  <a href="https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/california-designing-freedom" target="_blank">neoliberal Californian</a>
    ideology, that technology will fix everything, is not the case. It does
    terrible things to societies in many parts of the world. And it does
    shit for politics. And it’s useless for democracy. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">Not
    all of it, of course — there again there is nuance. But… there is
    definitely some type of discomfort. I think it’s only increasing. Maybe
    that will lead people to quit Facebook eventually. I don’t know how many
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=facebook+makes+you+depressed&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB757GB757&amp;amp;oq=facebook+makes+you+depressed&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5063j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">studies you have to read about the use of Facebook and your personal happiness</a> before you quit. Five of them, or ten of them, or 20?
</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer"> All these
    false promises of social media giving you what you want, when you want
    it, and it’s  going to make you great. Mark Zuckerberg says that as long
    as you give everyone a voice the world usually ends up in good place,
    which is also horseshit.
</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">But I
    always felt like I had proper agency. By some virtue of privilege, I
    happened to get interested in learning how to write code. I can
    understand better than the average person, perhaps, the systems of
    control, how they function. I usually quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k" target="_blank">Douglas Rushkoff</a>,
    although I don’t necessarily agree with it 100%. He says program or be
    programmed. So, either you learn how to program or you’re going to be
    programmed by the systems that govern society. It doesn’t mean you have
    to learn how to program, it just means you have to learn to recognise
    how certain systems favour certain behaviour, or how certain biases are
    integral to different systems online. Whether that’s <a href="https://searchengineland.com/what-is-google-pagerank-a-guide-for-searchers-webmasters-11068" target="_blank">Google PageRank</a> or <a href="http://edgerank.net/" target="_blank">Facebook EdgeRank</a>
    or whatever. It’s not objective. Once you get that, it gets easier to
    unravel more of this fuzzy logic they try and sell to you. Something
    like that? That sounds like there were some good quotes in that
    paragraph.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Hah!
    One of the things I find interesting in what you do is that there’s an
    element of distribution built into the work. Is that a conscious
    decision, or does the work just evolve that way?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">I
    think it’s something you’re often confronted with in some way, how you
    contextualise and how you position your work. How it is mediated,
    basically. That was always a concern, even if you were a painter way
    back in the day, because part of the distribution is also the reception
    of the work — how does it satisfy a potential client or whatever. It’s
    just more on steroids today, where the artist is also supposed to be
    their own branding specialist and you’re also supposed to be the PR, the
    art critic and a self-curator, so you know everything about everything,
    and you know how to write very long theoretical texts, and you know how
    to get 200 likes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonaslund/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, you know how to reach out to magazines, and you know how to answer smart, complicated questions in interviews.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question"><em>[Laughs]</em></p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">It’s
    just become much more professionalised in general, the whole art scene.
    It’s very difficult to get anywhere by being naive. Maybe it’s a shame,
    but I think in every different industry it’s the same because, through
    the networked effect, competition is just increased and the speed with
    which we share information or get information is also massively
    increased.</p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">At
    the heart of all my work is the network. Whether that’s a simplified,
    isolated network between two things, or a massive network between
    thousands of different nodes, part of the network is also the
    distribution model — how can you benefit from a networked effect of
    people wiring or thinking or exploring the works. So, I think it’s
    something that is embedded in all of it. It’s just there. </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Is
    the relationship in this kind of networked society that you describe,
    between the archive, production and distribution, becoming increasingly
    complicated?
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Yeah,
    for sure. Those different topics of mediation, distribution,
    production, archiving, they’re all kind of one, but separate. So, it’s
    difficult to tell where the line goes. I think I look more at the
    archive like a vast database which you have for yourself, but I’m not
    sure.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">You could talk about data as a form of archive…</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Yeah.
    I think the largest ongoing archive right now is Facebook. The intimate
    details of 2 billions people’s lives for the last like, I dunno, eight
    years. If you want to think about mankind in terms of that, it’s pretty
    crazy.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">It might also be interesting to think about how this is changing, because the Facebook demographic is getting older and <a href="https://medium.com/@ItsTheVocal/heres-why-young-people-are-abandoning-facebook-4acbc2200fcd" target="_blank">younger people don’t engage with Facebook like that</a> anymore and instead use these peer-to-peer messaging systems.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Thank god. I mean, it’s about time that Facebook is disrupted, right?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">But
    then I wonder about the role of something like Instagram, or Flickr
    even, in this exhibition of the self. So rather than just having the
    data collected, you’re selecting what data you want to present.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Yeah,
    for sure. It’s a strategy in some sense. It’s chasing some dopamine fix
    of getting liked, of being liked. I’m not sure what the implications
    are. Is the implication that your Instagram archive will make you happy,
    and show you the good things that happened to you in the last year, or
    will it be a reflection of all the shit that happened that you didn’t
    post? Is the end goal to have increased happiness? Is that we’re all
    looking for?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Do
    you think artists have a responsibility to develop works that help
    people engage with a more thoughtful approach to digital culture?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">I
    don’t think so. I don’t think it makes sense to claim responsibility by
    saying ‘oh artists should do this or that’. The role of art in society
    is to comment on certain things or inform people. </p></div><div class="interview"><p class="interview-answer">First
    of all, I’m highly sceptical of the idea that art informs public
    opinion. Hardly ever. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a function. I
    think one of the functions can be to [examine] in new and imaginative
    and innovative ways how we’re getting fucked over.

    One of the functions of art can be to comment on society, and I think
    that’s definitely an important part. It’s something I find very
    interesting in my point of view because at the end of the day it’s just
    about what it’s like to be human, no? It’s like art is like ‘this is
    just what it’s like’, and then you have to take that as a starting
    point. But I wouldn’t say it’s our responsibility. I would say it’s the
    politicians’ responsibility to listen to the people and create
    regulations to have a counter to the neoliberal agenda. That’s 100%
    true, that you need to start to regulate shit to take back control.
    Which is happening. Maybe not as fast as we would like to see it. But,
    nevertheless, it is happening.
</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">In the context of all of this, how do you decide what you’re going to develop for your next project?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">By complete random chance! No, I don’t know. I mean it’s hard to say because it really depends. <a href="https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/expert_eye/supercurator-hans-ulrich-obrist-on-what-makes-painting-an-urgent-medium-today-54218" target="_blank">The word that everybody loves in the art world is ‘urgency’</a>,
    so then it’s about what’s the most efficient use of your agency to
    capture the most urgent point. But in the end I don’t want to be overly
    strategic. It’s more like a feeling, or to explore something unknown or
    test a new idea, which could lead to something else. Maybe you will take
    the topic that will make you the least depressed. How do you decide
    what you’re going to research next?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Um,
    I read a lot and then if I find there’s a few different things that
    interest me in a similar way, then that is my next line of inquiry. </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">That’s
    a good answer! Yeah, I like it. I also read a lot. Yeah. OK, I read a
    lot. And then I think about it and then as all of these different
    readings emerge and they diverge, they reach a conclusion of amazingness
    and then boom, there it is! <em>[Laughs]</em> Yeah, I’m not sure. But
    you do consume a crazy amount of input and then you also have to stop
    for a while and go back to output I think. It’s a weird combination.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Are you ever surprised by the way your work is received or interpreted?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">I
    mean, I don’t think about it too much. What I find most interesting
    about it is the conversations that come out of it. Then it can lead
    somewhere else. I try and not care so much about if people like it or
    not, because I don’t want to use that as a metric for evaluating what’s
    successful or not, but of course it plays a part too. I usually say I
    don’t care so much about audience, which may be true or not. See? It’s
    all double! In some regards, yeah, it may be interesting to hear, in
    other regards it’s completely, completely irrelevant. It all depends on
    the purpose.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">With
    your workshop at Open Set Lab 2017, what’s the one thing that you would
    hope people would take away for themselves and their work?</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Oh,
    that’s a tricky one. An enlightened sense of agency within online
    systems, let’s say. I mean, I don’t know. It’s a bit silly to say that
    their biggest takeaway would be to be much more sceptical about what’s
    being sold to you, because I imagine that most Open Set participants
    already have a pretty high level of scepticism about different types of
    power structures. But you’ve got to stay vigilant and not get fooled by
    fake news. It’s quite difficult. Actually, it’s really difficult. It’s
    also about recognising the difficulties of manoeuvring within this
    landscape I think. </p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">AW</span><p class="interview-question">Thank you very much, I really enjoyed this conversation.</p></div><div class="interview"><span class="interview-voice">JL</span><p class="interview-answer">Alright cool, no problem.

                <div class="abstract">For a long time, the public sphere as a space in which rational debates are conducted, free of prescriptive forces, and public space as a common world were guiding concepts in the discourse on publicness defined by such thinkers as Jürgen Habermas and Hannah Arendt. These enlightened forms of ‘civilized publicness’ seem far removed from either the theory or the practice of the present day. Neoliberal forces, such as privatization and commercialization, are torpedoing the idealized modern concepts of the public sphere, which is being increasingly defined, in terms of a practical project, by acute expectations concerning security and threat. At the same time, public space is being claimed by groups and audiences such as illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, who are not accounted for, or only minimally, in official policy dealing with this space.</div>

                <div class="abstract">There is nothing new in camera images shot by amateurs being able to play a role as evidence and as a visual resource in the reporting and interpretation of signiﬁcant events – witness the Zapruder ﬁlm of the assassination of J.F. Kennedy or the Rodney King video tape. Now, however, digital media and the Internet seem to make an increasing intrusion of amateur images in the professional media inevitable. What is the status of these ‘wild’ images in the public domain? Do they reveal the new blind spots of the ofﬁcial news media? Or do they primarily demonstrate a public desire for images that almost eradicate the distance from events?</div>
