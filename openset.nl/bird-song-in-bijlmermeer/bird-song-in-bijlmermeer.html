 was the question that researcher, writer and art practitioner Nadia Al 
Issa / Christidi posed to the 2018 Open Set Summer School group. In her 
lecture at the opening symposium <em>Fluid Rhythms</em>, Nadia 
elaborated upon this question and introduced the audience to the 
framework that guided the Summer School project, entitled <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</em> 

</p><p>This project engaged with the tradition of bird singing 
competitions as an entry point into exploring colonial histories, 
postcolonial experiences, migration and community building, culture in 
translation, and the circulation of accompanying things (i.e. the 
economies of the bird trade, breeding, and betting). The group was 
invited to seek out ecosystems in Bijlmer that were of interest to them,
 through which they could similarly narrate the historical and political
 on a micro level, on the level of the everyday, as well as scale it up 
  to the bigger picture of global thematics.</p><figure>

Video, talk <em>Bird Song in Bijlmermeer: The Poetry and Politics of Intimate Entanglements</em>, August, 2018</span></div></figure><p>As
 Christidi introduces in her lecture, she approached the theme of 
rhythms through the idea of motion: through how, whether voluntarily or 
not, the rhythms of people and things simultaneously inhabit, develop 
in, or adapt to shared territories, conditions, and politics, and 
furthermore, how they influence each other and their shared context. To 
help us understand her perception of rhythm through motion, Christidi 
presented several key concepts, which were also the leading references 
for her Summer School workshop. These concepts invite us to focus on 
minor or neglected movements in culture and nature—the rhythms which 
were predominant in the research of the overall Open Set programme <em>Fluid Rhythms</em>. 

</p><p>The first of these key concepts is the idea of ‘minor histories’ 
(Ann Laura Stoler), which refers to incidents, movements and 
interactions that open up for us the ‘structure of feelings’ that might 
have been neglected by the major historical narratives. An alternative  
historical narration is proposed to be made through the rhythms of 
‘minor events’, by taking these events as points of references. 
Secondly, Christidi introduces the notion of ‘ruination’ (Stoler), an 
act of motion from the colonial aftermath’s traces on the material 
environment and on people's bodies and minds. This is seen as an ongoing
 act: a process that we inhabit. Thirdly, Christidi draws our attention 
to Anna Tsing’s understanding of ‘friction’ in relation to fluidity. The
 tension between different rhythms, or friction, is on one hand a 
necessary element for initiating a movement, but on the other hand, it 
slows down fluid movement or changes the direction of the movement. 
Finally, the concept of ‘ruderal ecologies’ (Bettina Stoetzer) looks at 
the nature that grows on the cracks of urban ruins. This opens up the 
perspective of the moderation of some rhythms. Regardless of the attempt
 to control nature, ruderal ecologies speak about its adaptation or 
survival—even if a plant, grass or other life matter is conditioned by 
the urban structure, it’s not completely determined by it. 

</p><p>In her talk, Nadia Christidi contextualizes these theoretical 
frameworks through her practice, which consists of PhD research, essays 
and visual narratives.
